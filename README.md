# Augmented Reality Space Book

Augmented Reality Space Book is an interactive and immersive educational experience that brings the wonders of our solar system to life. This project uses Unity and Vuforia Image Recognition System to create an engaging Ebook with augmentable pages, allowing users to explore planets, play games, and even step into the solar system through a portal.

## Features

- **Augmented Reality Ebook**: The planets pop up when the camera is placed on top of the corresponding page, allowing users to interact with 3D models of the planets by rotating and scaling them.
